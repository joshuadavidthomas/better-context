btca is a codebase research tool with three main entry points: CLI, web app, and MCP. Use
these docs to install it, add resources, configure providers, and connect your coding tools.

Use the guides to get set up, then jump into the API reference for exact request and
response shapes.

## Choose your workflow

Pick the setup that matches how you work:

- **CLI + Local MCP**: best when your code should stay on your machine.
- **Web app + Cloud API**: best for saved threads, projects, and cloud-indexed repos.
